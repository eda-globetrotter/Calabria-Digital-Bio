# Acknowledgements

## Classmates

### Teammates
I acknowledge that I have collaborated with my project teammates Diana Medina and Selene Howe to complete this homework. Specifically, we discussed some hypotheses for homework assigned for Thursday, June 26, 2014, and how to test those hypotheses.

### Other classmates
I also want to thank Ms. Priyadharshini Venkat, my classmate for this course, for giving me feedback about my hypotheses and helping me to find alternate golden models for the {\it Neurospora crassa} species.

Furthermore, I want to thank Ms. Priyadharshini Venkat and Ms. Elyssa Garza for explaining Phred quality scores in the context of the FastQ format for the {\it Neurospora crassa} species.

## Class Instructor and Teaching Assistant
I also acknowledge the help that I have received from the course instructor, Prof. Rodolfo Aramayo, in getting back to my queries about the source of the reference sequence for the *Neurospora crassa* species that was provided to us on Tuesday.

## Others
In addition, I want to thank Ms. Tess L. Pham from the Tutor Zone at Evans Library, which is run by the Academic Success Center at Texas A\&M University. Ms. Pham has tutored me about the basics of genetics and gave me feedback about the hypotheses which I proposed.
